Under is a list of member functions for vectors
///////////////////////////////////////////////

Constructor:
vector(): Constructs an empty vector.

Element Access:
at(index): Returns a reference to the element at a specified position.
operator[]: Returns a reference to the element at a specified position.
front(): Returns a reference to the first element.
back(): Returns a reference to the last element.
data(): Returns a pointer to the underlying array.

Modifiers:
push_back(element): Adds an element to the end.
pop_back(): Removes the last element.
insert(position, element): Inserts an element at a specified position.
erase(position): Removes an element at a specified position.
clear(): Removes all elements.
resize(new_size): Changes the size of the vector.
swap(other_vector): Swaps the contents with another vector.

Capacity:
size(): Returns the number of elements.
max_size(): Returns the maximum number of elements a vector can hold.
capacity(): Returns the size of the allocated storage capacity.
empty(): Returns whether the vector is empty.
reserve(new_capacity): Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain a certain number of elements.

Iterators:
begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the first element.
end(): Returns an iterator pointing one past the last element.
rbegin(): Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element.
rend(): Returns a reverse iterator pointing to one position before the first element.

Non-Member Functions:
std::swap(vector1, vector2): Swaps the contents of two vectors.
